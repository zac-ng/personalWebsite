                Follow my professional journey through the field of Computer Science!
                I have held a wide variety of roles, ranging from machine learning research at my university,
                to working on security toolset for blue team analysts, to building data pipelines for autonomous
                vehicles, to building an insurance pre-authorization using ChatGPT. I have learned a lot throughout
                my career, and I hope to learn a lot more in my future roles! If you are interested in hiring
                me, or what a deeper look at my work take a look at my resume <Link href="/resume.pdf" color="blue.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</Link>.
